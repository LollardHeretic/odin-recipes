        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Who doesn't love a juicy chargrilled beef burger loaded with melted cheese, tangy pickles and fresh crispy
            vegetables? I know my family does, which is why I often find myself making these insanely melt-in-the-mouth
            burgers on the regular. </p>
        <p>They are so easy to make and super low-cost and only require one pan (or a barbecue!) and 22 minutes -
            brilliant!

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>To a large bowl, add the beef mince, breadcrumbs, egg, Worcestershire sauce, ketchup, salt and pepper.
                Use
                your
                hands to combine well. Divide the mixture into 4–6 portions, then use your hands to form patties. Their
                size
                ideally needs to be just bigger than the burger buns you are using as the patties will shrink slightly
                as
                they
                cook. Want an extra veggie hit? See note 2.</li>
            <li>Use your thumb to make an indent in one side of the patty. This helps the patties keep their shape
                during
                cooking.</li>
            <li>Heat the olive oil in a heavy-based frying pan over medium–high heat. Cook the burger patties for 10–12
                minutes,
                turning once halfway through. Add the water to the pan in the last 2 minutes of cooking. This step is
                optional,
                it allows you to scrape up all of the delicious sticky bits in the base of the pan and they cling to the
                outside
                of the patties = more flavour! For a delicious chargrilled result, you can cook the patties in a
                chargrill
                pan
                or cook them on a barbecue plate. Heat the plate to medium–high, spray the plate with oil just before
                cooking
                and cook the patties for 10–12 minutes, turning once halfway. </li>
            <li>Serve the brioche buns topped with burger patties, cheese, tomato, red onion, gherkins, lettuce,
                whole-egg
                mayonnaise, ketchup and American mustard. Serve immediately!</li>
